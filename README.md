Language Implementation Patterns
================================

Conversion to Ruby of the examples in the book Language Implementation Patterns by Terence Parr.

The parsing chapter is largely contained in the top directory. After that, I have made separate
self-contained directories.

There is no non-independent printing visitor example, because double-dispatch is not possible (easily)
in Ruby.
